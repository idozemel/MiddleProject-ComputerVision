# MiddleProject-ComputerVision

In this project I have written a neural network from scratch.                         
Taking the database of Mnist from 0 to 9, picking two numbers,I have picked the numbers 0 and 1.            
Afterwards there is front&back propogation with updating the weights of NN
   
My module has a 92% accuracy on the test set.
